# Clippy Configuration
# This file configures Rust's clippy linter for the Sword Spinner project

# Warn on all clippy lints by default
# Use: cargo clippy -- -D warnings (to treat warnings as errors)

# Enable pedantic lints for better code quality
# These catch common mistakes and non-idiomatic code

# Complexity - warn about overly complex code
